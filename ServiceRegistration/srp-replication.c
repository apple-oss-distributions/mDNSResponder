//
// 1. Enumerate all SRP servers that are participating in synchronization on infrastructure: This is done by looking up
//    NS records for <thread-network-name>.thread.home.arpa with the ForceMulticast flag set so that we use mDNS to
//    discover them.

// 2. For each identified server that is not this server, look up A and AAAA records for the server's hostname.

// 3. Maintain a state object with the list of IP addresses and an index to the current server being tried.

// 4. Try to connect to the first address on the list -> connection management state machine:

//   * When we have established an outgoing connection to a server, generate a random 64-bit unsigned number and send a
//     SRPLSession DSO message using that number as the server ID.

//   * When we receive an SRPLSession DSO message, see if we have an outgoing connection from the same server
//     for which we've sent a server ID. If so, and if the server id we received is less than the one we sent,
//     terminate the outgoing connection. If the server ids are equal, generate a new server id for the outgoing
//     connection and send another session establishment message.
//
//   * When we receive an acknowledgement to our SRPLSession DSO message, see if we have an incoming
//     connection from the same server from which we've received a server id. If the server id we received is less
//     than the one we sent, terminate the outgoing connection. If the server ids are equal, generate a new random
//     number for the outgoing connection and send another session establishment message.
//
//   * When a connection from a server is terminated, see if we have an established outgoing connection with that
//     server.  If not, attempt to connect to the next address we have for that server.
//
//   * When our connection to a server is terminated or fails, and there is no established incoming connection from that
//     server, attempt to connect to the next address we have for that server.
//
//   * When the NS record for a server goes away, drop any outgoing connection to that server and discontinue trying to
//     connect to it.
//
// 5. When we have established a session, meaning that we either got an acknowledgment to a SRPLSession DSO
//    message that we sent and _didn't_ drop the connection, or we got an SRPLSession DSO message on an
//    incoming connection with a lower server id than the outgoing connection, we begin the synchronization process.
//
//    * Immediately following session establishment, we generate a list of candidate hosts to send to the other server
//      from our internal list of SRP hosts (clients). Every non-expired host entry goes into the candidate list.
//
//    * Then, if we are the originator, we sent an SRPLSendCandidates message.
//
//    * If we are the recipient, we wait for an SRPLSendCandidates message.
//
//    * When we receive an SRPLSendCandidates message, we iterate across the candidates list, for each
//      candidate sending an SRPLCandidate message containing the host key, current time, and last message
//      received times, in seconds since the epoch. When we come to the end of the candidates list, we send an
//      acknowledgement to the SRPLSendCandidates message and discard the candidates list.
//
//    * When we receive an SRPLCandidate message, we look in our own candidate list, if there is one, to see
//      if the host key is present in the candidates list. If it is not present, or if it is present and the received
//      time from the SRPLCandidate message is later than the time we have recorded in our own candidate
//      list, we send an SRPLCandidateRequest message with the host key from the SRPLCandidate
//      message.
//
//    * When we receive an SRPLCandidateRequest message, we send an SRPLHost message which
//      encapsulates the SRP update for the host and includes the timestamp when we received the SRP update from that
//      host, which may have changed since we sent the SRPLCandidate message.
//
//    * When we receive an SRPLHost message, we look in our list of hosts (SRP clients) for a matching
//      host. If no such host exists, or if it exists and the timestamp is less than the timestamp in the
//      SRPLHost message, we process the SRP update from the SRPLHost message and mark the host as
//      "not received locally."  In other words, this message was not received directly from an SRP client, but rather
//      indirectly through our SRP replication partner. Note that this message cannot be assumed to be syntactically
//      correct and must be treated like any other data received from the network. If we are sent an invalid message,
//      this is an indication that our partner is broken in some way, since it should have validated the message before
//      accepting it.
//
//    * Whenever the SRP engine applies an SRP update from a host, it also delivers that update to each replication
//      server state engine.
//
//      * That replication server state engine first checks to see if it is connected to its partner; if not, no action
//        is taken.
//
//      * It then checks to see if there is a candidate list.
//        * If so, it checks to see if the host implicated in the update is already on the candidate list.
//          * If so, it updates that candidate's update time.
//          * If not, it adds the host to the end of the candidate list.
//        * If not, it sends an SRPLCandidate message to the other replication server, with the host
//          key and new timestamp.
//
// 6. When there is more than one SRP server participating in replication, only one server should advertise using
//    mDNS. All other servers should only advertise using DNS and DNS Push (SRP scalability feature). The SRP server
//    with the lowest numbered server ID is the one that acts as an advertising proxy for SRP. In practice this means
//    that if we have the lowest server ID of all the SRP servers we are connected to, we advertise mDNS. If two servers
//    on the same link can't connect to each other, they probably can't see each others' multicasts, so this is the
//    right outcome.
