 *
 * Set the specified variable to the specified value on the advertising proxy
 *
 * advertising_proxy_set_variable() Parameters:
 *
 * conn_ref:                  A pointer to advertising_proxy_conn_ref that is initialized to NULL.
 *                            If the call succeeds it will be initialized to a non-NULL value.
 *                            The same conn_ref can be used for more than one call.
 *
 * clientq:                   Queue the client wants to schedule the callback on (Note: Must not be NULL)
 *
 * callback:                  Callback function for the client that indicates success or failure.
 *                            Callback is not called until either the command has failed, or has completed.
 *
 * context:                   Context to return in callback
 *
 * variable:                  Name of variable to set
 *
 * value:                     Value to set. Value is a string which will be interpreted by the advertising proxy,
 *                            and can be a quoted string ("\"foo\""), "NULL", a number ("100"), or a boolean
 *                            ("true" or "false") depending on the variable's type.
 *
 * return value:              Returns kDNSSDAdvertisingProxy_NoError when no error otherwise returns an
 *                            error code indicating the error that occurred. Note: A return value of
 *                            kDNSSDAdvertisingProxy_NoError does not mean that srp replication connections
 *                            were successfully dropped. The callback may asynchronously return an
 *                            error (such as kDNSSDAdvertisingProxy_DaemonNotRunning)
